# odin-bubble-sort

This is my implementation of the "Bubble Sort" assignment from The Odin Project Ruby on Rails curriculum.

Instructions:

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology.

> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
